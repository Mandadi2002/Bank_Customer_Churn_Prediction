Abstract
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, directly impacting revenue and long-term sustainability. This project focuses on developing and deploying a robust customer churn prediction system, leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and data analytics. The solution is designed to identify customers likely to discontinue services or purchases, enabling proactive retention strategies.

The deployment process integrates seamlessly with business operations through an automated pipeline, utilizing scalable cloud-based infrastructure for real-time predictions. Key features include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment using tools like Python, Flask, Docker, and AWS. The system is tailored for high interpretability, offering actionable insights into churn drivers through explainable AI techniques.

The deployment is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to ensure high accuracy and reliability. By transforming raw data into predictive insights, this project empowers organizations to reduce churn rates, optimize customer engagement, and maximize profitability.
