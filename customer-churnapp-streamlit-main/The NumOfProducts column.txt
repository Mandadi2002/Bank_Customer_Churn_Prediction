The NumOfProducts column in the bank customer churn dataset indicates the number of bank products the customer has subscribed to, such as savings accounts, credit cards, loans, etc. The column has four possible values: 1, 2, 3, or 4. This column can be used to analyze the relationship between product usage and customer churn. For example, according to this article, customers who have more than two products are more likely to churn than those who have one or two products. This could be because customers who have more products are more likely to have complex financial needs and expectations, and may be dissatisfied with the bank’s services or offers. Alternatively, customers who have fewer products may be more loyal or satisfied with the bank, or may have lower switching costs or barriers. Therefore, the NumOfProducts column can provide valuable insights for banks to understand their customers’ preferences and behavior, and to design effective retention strategies.
